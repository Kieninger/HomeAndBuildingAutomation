#### Disable Logging
Comment out this line in etc\inittab
```
#Spawn a getty on Raspberry Pi serial line
#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
```
#### Remove any ttyAMA0 reference:
In /boot/cmdline.txt remove any ttyAMA0 reference

#### Change open hab config
```
enocean:serialPort=/dev/ttyAMA0
```

#### Add following line to start.sh and start_debug.sh
Just a line before the line with -jar
```
-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyAMA0 \
```

Restart the raspberry
Check the source files for openhab configuration

### HUE LAMPS
#### Lamp stealer
Tried it with this link before
https://www.dmlights.com/philips-hue-faq.l

1) Download the LampStealer zip file.
2) Open the Mac application or the java jar.
3) Find your bridge.
4) Bring the light you want to connect close to your bridge.
5) Start up the link process.
6) Search for new lights in the Hue app

But this didn't work so I tried to steal the lamp with telnet

Connection via telnet
https://nohats.ca/wordpress/blog/2013/05/26/philips-hue-alternative-for-lamp-stealer/

Enable telnet on windows
http://windows.microsoft.com/de-at/windows/telnet-faq#1TC=windows-7
```
open <YOUR_IP_OF_THE_BRIDGE> 30000
[Link,Touchlink]
```

#### HUE with OpenHab
https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hue-Binding

I have used org.openhab.binding.hue-1.8.3.jar as binding

Cannot connect to the bridge
-> Solution
http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started
It describes how to register manually to to bridge

Lamp has to be near (30cm) to the bridge

1) Enter in browser: http://<YOUR_IP_OF_THE_BRIDGE>/debug/clip.html
2) Enter in url field "/api/"
3) Enter MessageBody in field {"devicetype":"my_hue_app#florian"}
4) Press post and press the link button
5) Add the username to your config file
```
hue:ip=<YOUR_IP_OF_THE_BRIDGE>
hue:secret=6v6GLbtEuQQ4S4Kml1YyPvRIz8qg0fWBf1E00mlC
hue:refresh=10000
```
